Welcome to GravityApp by Garrett Kunkler
 
Overview
 
This is a program designed to simulate gravitational fields between planets.
 The left side of the window is a field for placing masses and viewing their interactions
 The program is written in Java during the 2019-2020 school year
 
Masses
 
This application works by creating stationary(red) and moving(black) masses.
The red masses cannot move, but the black masses do.
The radius of the masses is proportional to its mass
	-Minimum radius = 2
	-Maximum radius = 10
If two masses get close enough, they will combine into one mass.
	-If one of the masses is a red mass, 
	 then the mass of the black mass will be added to the red mass and the black mass will be removed
	-If both masses are black, then one of them(it doesn't matter) will be deleted
	 and the mass of the deleted mass will be added to the other mass
	-New x and y velocities are calculated using v = ( v1m1 + v2m2 )/( m1 + m2 )
	 for a perfectly inelastic collision
 
Control Panel 
 
The mass slider changes the mass of the masses when you place them. 
Depending on whether the moving mass or pinned mass toggle is selected,
 that type of mass will be placed onto the gray gravity board
 
The max speed slider allows you to control how fast the moving masses can travel.
If this slider is at its max value, there will be no max speed.
This slider is useful for:
	-setting the velocity of the moving masses to zero.
	-preventing the moving masses from traveling too far in one frame.
	-aiding the viewing experience
	 
The vector field will show and point in the direction of force due to the stationary masses.
	-Is not effected by moving masses
	-Inaccuracies are due to rounding errors
 
The wall toggle button can turn on and off the walls.
If the moving masses travel off of the screen when the walls are off,
 they will be removed
  
The clear all button removes all stationary and moving masses.
 
Details

-The max number of stationary masses is 10
-The max number of moving masses is 3
